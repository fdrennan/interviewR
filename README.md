# interviewR
An R repo with questions for a Quantum interviewee. The questions are specified below but any data required to solve the problem is either in `Quantum_Assessment.Rmd` or `daily_data.rda`. 
Please return your solution as a PR in a well organized and clean RMarkdown file. Clean and well documented code is highly encouraged. Extensive use of tidyverse tools is recommended.  


## The Birthday Problem

This is a simple problem designed to see how you break down a problem, functions used, and the cleanliness of a solution. Bonus points for parameterized functions intended to generalize the solution. 

## The Advertising Problem

This problem is designed to test your ability to formulate an LP. There is less emphasis on cleanliness and more emphasis on the actual solution to the problem. 

## EDA

Take the file from the repo called `daily_data.rda` and do an EDA. What do you find? This is your chance to do open ended EDA and show us what you've got.
