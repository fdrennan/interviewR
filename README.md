# interviewR
An R repo with questions for a Quantum interviewee. The questions are specified below but any data required to solve the problem is either in `Quantum_Assessment.Rmd` or `daily_data.rda`. 
Please return you solution in a well organized and clean RMarkdown file. Clean and well documented code is highly encouraged. Extensive use of tidyverse tools is recommended.  


## The Birthday Problem

Use monte-carlo methods to solve. This is a simple problem designed to see how you break down a problem, functions used, and the cleanliness of a solution. 

## The Advertising Problem

This problem is designed to test your ability to formulate an LP. There is emphasis on cleanliness and more on the actual solution to the problem. Cleanliness is always desired. 

## EDA

Take the file from the repo called `daily_data.rda` and do an EDA. What do you find? The lowest level of an advertisment is an adgroup id. This is your chance to do open ended EDA and show us what you've got.
